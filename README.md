# about `README.md` 
The intro file is used to provide project orientation. The file defines project objectives and is intended to introduce project data, source code and configurations for repeatable research. The *.md file format is that of a basic text or markdown file. When saved to GitHub, it will be used to create an HTML project wiki.
